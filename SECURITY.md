# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The security of this project is taken seriously. If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities, please report them to the project maintainers. We appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing the issue and working with us to ensure a secure environment for all users.

To report a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and any relevant details.
2. Allow a reasonable time for the maintainers to assess and address the issue. We will make every effort to respond to security-related issues promptly and provide updates on the progress.

Please refrain from publicly disclosing any potential security vulnerabilities until they have been addressed by the project maintainers.

## Supported Versions

This section lists the versions of the project that are currently being supported with security updates. It is recommended to use the latest stable release whenever possible.

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 0.4.0     | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.3.x     | :x:                |
| 0.2.x     | :x:                |

## Security Measures

In this section, you can outline any specific security measures that have been implemented in the project, such as:

- Input validation and sanitization procedures
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Encryption or hashing algorithms used
- Handling of sensitive data

### Example Security Measures:

- The project uses discord.py's built-in command system, which helps with command parsing and validation.
- User input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent common vulnerabilities such as code injection or SQL injection.
- Sensitive data, such as the Discord token, is stored securely and accessed through environment variables.

## Dependencies

Listed below are the main dependencies of the project along with their versions. Keeping these dependencies up-to-date is important for security purposes.

| Dependency        | Version  |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| discord           | 2.3.0    |
| discord.py        | 2.3.1    |
| python-dotenv     | 1.0.0   |

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your Discord bot code, consider following these best practices:

- **Use a strong and unique Discord token**: Generate a secure token for your bot and avoid sharing it publicly. Treat it as a sensitive credential.
- **Implement proper permission checks**: Only grant necessary permissions to your bot and ensure it has appropriate restrictions for accessing sensitive or privileged operations.
- **Securely handle user input**: Sanitize and validate any user input to prevent common vulnerabilities like code injection or unauthorized access.
- **Keep dependencies up-to-date**: Regularly update your dependencies to the latest secure versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
- **Protect sensitive information**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data like database credentials or API keys in your code. Use environment variables or configuration files instead.

For more information and detailed security practices, refer to the [Discord Developer Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).
